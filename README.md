## What is Any2Graph ?

When you want to train a model for a task where the **input** is graph, you can use a Graph Neural Network. But what about tasks where the **output** is a graph? This is where _Any2Graph_ comes into play!

Any2Graph is a framework composed of 1) a continuous graph representation, 2) an architecture, and 3) a loss (PMFGW). See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12269) for more details.
